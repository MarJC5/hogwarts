# Coding Challenge

## The Challenge: Hogwarts House Points Management Web App

### Objective:
Develop a web application that allows Hogwarts teachers to easily add or remove points from the houses (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw) based on the actions or behavior of the students.

### Key Features:

1. **User Interface (Frontend):**
   - Provide an intuitive UI where teachers can see the current points for each house.
   - Offer controls (e.g., buttons, forms) to add or subtract points from each house.
   - Any other optional features you see fit.

2. **Backend & API:**
   - Create a backend that exposes an API to fetch the current points for each house, update points, and (optionally) retrieve transaction history.
   - Ensure that endpoints perform proper validation (e.g., valid house names, non-negative points if applicable, etc.) and return clear success/failure responses.

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - Use any form of database to store houses and their points.

4. **General Requirements:**
   - The complete project (frontend, backend, and API) must run locally with minimal setup.
   - You are free to choose any technology stack or framework.

### Presentation:
Your presentation should cover:
- An overview of your solution and design decisions.
- A demonstration of how the app works.
- A brief explanation (in non-technical terms) of how you solved the challenge and why you chose your specific stack/approach.

### Submission Instructions:
1. **Repository:**
   Provide repository access on your preferred platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

2. **Presentation:**
   Prepare to present your project. You may choose to do a live demo or share a recorded walkthrough.
